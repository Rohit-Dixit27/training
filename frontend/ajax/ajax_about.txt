--------Ajax
->Update a web page without reloading the page
->Request data from a server - after the page has loaded
->Receive data from a server - after the page has loaded
->Send data to a server - in the background

--------How Ajax works
1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
4. The server processes the request
5. The server sends a response back to the web page
6. The response is read by JavaScript
7. Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript

-------The XMLHttpRequest Object

All modern browsers support the XMLHttpRequest object.
The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to exchange data with a server behind the scenes. 
This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
