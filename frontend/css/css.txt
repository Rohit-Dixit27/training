----------CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

syntax->
p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}

p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: <p>).
color is a property, and red is the property value
text-align is a property, and center is the property value

--------->types of CSS
[css having priority like if we define css on p in head then in p tag also then css in p will have high priority.]
---->inline
we put css inside the tag.
e.g->
<body>
    <p style="color: blue;">this is css</p>
</body>

--->internal
use style tag in head of html file and write their.
e.g->
<head>
<style>
p {
  color: red;
  text-align: center;
}
</style>
</head>
[this is apply on p element]

---->external
in this we create a separate file and link that to our html code.
e.g-> in html code link that file.
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">


----->favicon icon
Showing on the tab of website.
download an icon store in images folder now connect it in index.html

 <link rel="shortcut icon" href="images/favicon.ico" type="image">


------CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

--Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)

-selector based on name element
e.g->
p{
    color: blue;
}
[here all p tag elements will be in blue color.]

-selector based on id.
we define id for every element then we can its style separately like one p tag having id=first,then
it use #id then definition.
#first{
    color: red;
}

-selector based on class
we deine class in elements,then style them using .classname
[we can provide more clases in one element also]

--Universal selector
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the pages.
e.g->
*{
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
}
--grouping selector
if we want to provide same properties to or more elements then we can define them with thierclasses or ids using ,
e.g->
.article1, .article2 {
    color: green;
}
[here both class defined together]

--nesting selector
we can nest like if we need in article1 element then p element should in a color that is differenet from whole article element,then
e.g->
.article1>#first{
    color: red;
}
[it will see in article1 then inside find id first and make it red.]

--specificity order
id > class > element
[id having high priority then clas and then element]
