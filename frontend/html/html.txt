<html>

   <head>
      <title>This is document title</title>
   </head>
	
   <body>
      <p>content</p>
   </body>

--using <pre>
<p> <pre>def show
    end</pre>
   </p>
output- def show
        end

7)Non breaking spaces 
-some times we have a big paragraph that we but set in multiple lines but we want the text be together, so use &nbsp;
-Suppose you want to use the phrase "12 Angry Men." Here, you would not want a browser to split the "12, Angry" and "Men" across two lines −

---Nesting Elements
An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it ends with a closing tag.
we can nest the html elements, one element inside another element.

----Attributes
An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the element's opening tag.
All attributes are made up of two parts − a name and a value

name-is the property you want to set.
value- is what you want the value of the property to be set and always put within quotations.

e.g->
<p align="left">this should at left</p>
name-align
value-left

--Core Attributes
1)id-If you have two elements of the same name within a Web page (or style sheet), helps to distnguish between them.
 e.g-><p id="name">this is my name</p>

2)class-The class attribute is used to associate an element with a style sheet, and specifies the class of element.

3)dir-The dir attribute allows you to indicate to the browser about the direction in which the text should flow.
it can be-

ltr- Left to right (the default value), set <html dir = "ltr"></html>
rtl- Right to left (for languages such as Hebrew or Arabic that are read right to left),set <html dir = "rtl"></html>

4)xml:lang-The xml:lang attribute is the XHTML replacement for the lang attribute, It indicates the main language used in a document.
e.g->html xml:lang = "en">

----Formatting tags
1)Bold-to make text bold, use <b>Bold</b>

2)italic-to make text italic, user </i>italic</i>

3)underline-to make text underline use, <u>underline</u>

4)strike-make a thin line through the text,use <strike>text</strike>

5)monospaced-The content of a <tt>...</tt> element is written in monospaced font. Most of the fonts are known as variable-width fonts because,
different letters are of different widths (for example, the letter 'm' is wider than the letter 'i'). 
In a monospaced font, however, each letter has the same width.

6)superscript-to make text superscript, use <sup>

7)subscript-to make text subscript, use <sub>

8)inserted-make text inserted using, <ins>

-div, it is a container took whole width
-span, it took width as per the text.
