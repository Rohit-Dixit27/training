HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web pages.

-->Applications of HTML

-Web pages development 
-Internet Navigation
-Responsive UI 
-Offline support HTML pages once loaded can be made available offline on the machine without any need of internet.
-Game development

-->Basic structure of HTML
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- shows doctype and html version that is HTML5 -->
<html>

   <head>
      <title>This is document title</title>
   </head>
	
   <body>
      <p>content</p>
   </body>
	
</html>


-->Basic tags
1)Heading tags[six level of heading.]
->h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6

2)paragraph tag[structure text into paragraphs.] <p>
3)line break tag[for break the line] <br /> 
4)center tag [to make the text in center]<center>
5)horizontal lines <hr />
6)preserve formatting <pre>
e.g->
<p>def show
    end
   </p>
output-> def show end

--using <pre>
<p> <pre>def show
    end</pre>
   </p>
output- def show
        end

7)Non breaking spaces 
-some times we have a big paragraph that we but set in multiple lines but we want the text be together, so use &nbsp;
-Suppose you want to use the phrase "12 Angry Men." Here, you would not want a browser to split the "12, Angry" and "Men" across two lines −

---Nesting Elements
An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it ends with a closing tag.
we can nest the html elements, one element inside another element.

----Attributes
An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed inside the element's opening tag.
All attributes are made up of two parts − a name and a value

name-is the property you want to set.
value- is what you want the value of the property to be set and always put within quotations.

e.g->
<p align="left">this should at left</p>
name-align
value-left

--Core Attributes
1)id-If you have two elements of the same name within a Web page (or style sheet), helps to distnguish between them.
 e.g-><p id="name">this is my name</p>

2)class-The class attribute is used to associate an element with a style sheet, and specifies the class of element.

3)dir-The dir attribute allows you to indicate to the browser about the direction in which the text should flow.
it can be-

ltr- Left to right (the default value), set <html dir = "ltr"></html>
rtl- Right to left (for languages such as Hebrew or Arabic that are read right to left),set <html dir = "rtl"></html>

4)xml:lang-The xml:lang attribute is the XHTML replacement for the lang attribute, It indicates the main language used in a document.
e.g->html xml:lang = "en">

----Formatting tags
1)Bold-to make text bold, use <b>Bold</b>

2)italic-to make text italic, user </i>italic</i>

3)underline-to make text underline use, <u>underline</u>

4)strike-make a thin line through the text,use <strike>text</strike>

5)monospaced-The content of a <tt>...</tt> element is written in monospaced font. Most of the fonts are known as variable-width fonts because,
different letters are of different widths (for example, the letter 'm' is wider than the letter 'i'). 
In a monospaced font, however, each letter has the same width.

6)superscript-to make text superscript, use <sup>

7)subscript-to make text subscript, use <sub>

8)inserted-make text inserted using, <ins>

9)deleted-make text deleted using, <del>.

10)larger-make text big as compared to other texts, <big>

11)smaller-make text small as compared to others,<small>

12)grouping-using div and span

-div, it is a container took whole width
-span, it took width as per the text.

-------Phrase tags

If present, the title attribute must contain this full description and nothing else.

5)Acronym Element
The <acronym> element allows you to indicate that the text between <acronym> and </acronym> tags is an acronym.
At present, the major browsers do not change the appearance of the content of the <acronym> element.

6)Text Direction
The <bdo>...</bdo> element stands for Bi-Directional Override and it is used to override the current text direction.

7)Special Terms

It's usage is similar to italic words in the midst of a paragraph.

8)Quoting Text

10)Text Citations

As you would expect in a print publication, the content of the <cite> element is rendered in italicized text by default.

11)Computer Code
Any programming code to appear on a Web page should be placed inside <code>...</code> tags.

12)Keyboard Text
When you are talking about computers, if you want to tell a reader to enter some text, you can use the <kbd>...</kbd> element to indicate what should be typed in.

<img src = "images/book1.png" alt = "book" width = "100" border="3" align = "right" />


----->Table
The HTML tables allow web authors to arrange data like text, images, links, other tables, etc. into rows and columns of cells.

<th> - Table heading can be defined using <th> tag. 
<tr> - for table rows
<td> - table data
<caption> - shows on the top of the table as title of table.

--The three elements for separating the head, body, and foot of a table are −

<thead> − to create a separate table header.

<tbody> − to indicate the main body of the table.

<tfoot> − to create a separate table footer.
[header and footer should be declared before body.]

->bgcolor - set background color.
->background - set background images.
-colspan - to merge columns.
-rowspan - to merge rows.
-border - to set border of table.
-cellspacing - to set spacing between cells.
-cellpadding - to set spacing between cellborder and content.

------HTML Lists
HTML offers web authors three ways for specifying lists of information. All lists must contain one or more list elements. Lists may contain −

<ul> − An unordered list. This will list items using plain bullets.

<ol> − An ordered list. This will use different schemes of numbers to list your items.

<dl> − A definition list. This arranges your items in the same way as they are arranged in a dictionary.

1)<ul>, we can also type atrribute to specify type of bullet.
<ul type = "square">
<ul type = "disc">
<ul type = "circle">

2)<ol>, we can specify type of number.
<ol type = "1"> - Default-Case Numerals.
<ol type = "I"> - Upper-Case Numerals.
<ol type = "i"> - Lower-Case Numerals.
<ol type = "A"> - Upper-Case Letters.
<ol type = "a"> - Lower-Case Letters.
--and also start point.


3)HTML Definition Lists,<dl>
HTML and XHTML supports a list style which is called definition lists where entries are listed like in a dictionary or encyclopedia. 
The definition list is the ideal way to present a glossary, list of terms, or other name/value list.

-Definition List makes use of following three tags.

<dl> − Defines the start of the list
<dt> − A term
<dd> − Term definition
</dl> − Defines the end of the list

---hyperlink
Hyperlinks allow visitors to navigate between Web sites by clicking on words, phrases, and images.
-used <a href = "url" target = "_self">click</a>
-target used to specfiy where we want to open that file like in same frame,new tab.
-we can set base address for a website then we dont want to write full url for every page.
-set color using of link before click(link), while click(active link) and after click(vlink) <body alink = "#54A250" link = "#040404" vlink = "#F40633">


--iframe
An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.

--colors
colors can also be specified using RGB values, HEX values, HSL values, RGBA values, and HSLA values.
->set background color = <p style="background-color:Tomato;">this is  background</p>
->set text color = <p style="color:green">thiis is text</p>
->set border color = <h1 style="border:2px solid Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
