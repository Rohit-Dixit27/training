     ->RVM is short for Ruby Version Manager. It is a platform of software for UNIX-like operating systems developed for managing more than one Ruby installation on similar devices.
     
     
     
     We can install and configure Ruby Version Manager in three different ways which are listed and explained below:

	1. Single-User Installations (suggested): For a separated install in the $HOME directory of a user, not for sudo or root.

	2. Multi-User Installations (recommended for server administrators): For the installation usable by every user on the system. Als	o, it used to be known as the System-Wide install. Using this 	kind of installation without knowing can lead to a big risk of security.

	Note: Single-User Installation supersedes the Multi-User Installation.
	
	3. Mixed-Mode Installations: For the installation usable by every user on the system with separated gemsets/rubies in the $HOME directory of a user. The instructions of the installation are the 	same as for the installations of Multi-User, the only difference is the environment of the user.
  
     - sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common  (install the software-properties-common Ubuntu package to permit the inclusion of the Personal Package Archive (or PPA))
  
     -sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:rael-gc/rvm(add the Personal Package Archive for RVM with the help of the following command.)
  
     -sudo apt-get install -y rvm  ( install RVM )
  
     -source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh 
   
     -rvm --version(to know the version)
     
     
  
 - revm install [version] (install ruby with specified version)
  
  
  
  

     ->  Ruby language statements can be executed through 'irb' integrated shell.

            $ irb

            - now run any ruby statement

    
    ->  You can also run ruby files through :

            $ ruby file_name.rb

        *(ruby files have .rb extension)
