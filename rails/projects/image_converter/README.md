Convert image to base64.

-Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data.
-That needs to be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with ASCII.
-This is to ensure that the data remain intact without modification during transport.

Create app/services/image_convert.rb
to make controller clean and write the business logic here.
