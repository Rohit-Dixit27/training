    [Note-Employees relation describes pilots and other kinds of employees as well.Every pilot is certified for some aircraft and only pilots are certified to fly.]  		
      		
  
  
  
 QUERIE a).Find the names of aircraft such that all pilots certified to operate them earn more than $80,000.
 
      	SOLUTION:-
      			SELECT a.aname as Aircraft
      			FROM EMPLOYEES e INNER JOIN
      			CERTIFIED c ON e.eid=c.eid
      			INNER JOIN AIRCRAFT a ON
      			c.aid=a.aid WHERE e.salary>$80,000;
